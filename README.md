## The Stock Ticker Prices App
The app lives at https://bhavikaj-dataincubator-project.herokuapp.com/index.

#### Details
The app was created for the Data Incubator course using Python Flask and Bokeh for plotting. The app asks for the input about a stock ticker(for example GOOG(for Google)) and the type of price(close,open,adj_close and adj_open) that needs to be plotted.
Once the inputs are given, the app plots the prices taken from the https://www.quandl.com/databases/WIKIP database which is publicly available.
